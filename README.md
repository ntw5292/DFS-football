Scraping/analysis of data for DFS football on FD and DK

Working on creating a tool for DFS football on both the Draftkings and Fanduel sites. Data currently includes betting lines (through 2018 week 13) from a Kaggle dataset, play by play data for 2010-2018 using the nflscrapR package, Fanduel salaries (from 2011-2018) and Draftkings salaries (2014-2018) scraped from Rotoguru using the rvest package.
