The different data sets have a common key to relate one set to the others. One will need to be created.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

pbp_data <- read_csv(here("Data/play_by_play.csv"))
salary_data <- read_csv(here("Data/salary_data.csv"))
betting_lines <- read_csv(here("Data/betting_lines.csv"))
```

For games:
The play by play data and betting lines data have a date column, those can be tied together
The betting lines and salary data have week/season data, those can be tied together

For players:
The salary data has player names in Last, First format, the pay by play data has F.Last. There's also a player_id column, need to figure out how to get full names for the play by play data.
